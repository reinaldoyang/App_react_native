# GarudaHack-3.0
Indonesia's Hackathon Project
Rural Development Track

##Inspiration
With Indonesia's diversity in culture , Indonesia have long been the suppllier of numerous products, yet millions of smallholders can't leverage these opportunities due to limited access to financial services and exposure

##What it does
It enables people living in rural areas to leverage their opportunities. Our mission is to connect them with modern society, by introducing their skill, product, or culture to the world. Giving them exposure and publicity.

##How we built it
We built it using react-native. Version : node - v16.17 npm - 8.3.1 expo - 5.5.1

##Challenges we ran into
Since its our first hackhaton and our first project using react-native, we ran into quite a lot of problems, one of which is the installation part, and for the functionality of the project itself, we ran into some errors regarding the navigation as well as the UI for designing the app.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we can finish this hackhaton on time, even though we know there are some room that we still want to improve in IndoDesa. Learning new skill is also something that we are proud of.

##What we learned
We acquired new skills through this hackhaton which is react-native, and we are happy that we can make our Idea possible through IndoDesa.

##What's next for IndoDesa
Add more features :

Itinerary of the program and the exact way to get there (Can integerate with google maps API and work with indonesia travel agency, to buy tickets or explore while in Indonesia).
Add in chat app features with auto translation, so the locals and investors can communicate.
Now, we can only use search in our app. So we can add filter to sort which sector (Agriculture, Art, Performance, etc) to make it a lot easier to navigate through all the contents.
Features for locals to see other locals to get to know them better and maybe merge their business.
We are imagining that we can have an app that have access to most of Indonesia's culture, and their creativity product.
